# Source Code Editor
This is a source code editor built from scratch using JS, jQuery.
The aim is to process the user input and provide most efficient syntax-highlight algorithms.
This is still in pre-alpha stage. Please report all missing/requested features under Issues.
If you're interested, try improving the UX of a textarea widget. For example, MS Office 2016 had this feature of 'animated caret' that is suprisingly soothing to the eyes.
